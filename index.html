  <h1>Facebook Photo Bookmarklet</h1>
  <p>Want to easily download all the photos you're tagged in on Facebook? Of course you do. Facebook doesn't want you to, because they're assholes. Screw that. Here's a quick and dirty solution.</p>
  <p>The instructions are for your tagged photos, but this will actually work on any album. Enjoy.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
    Use Firefox.
    </li>

    <li>
    Install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/">DownThemAll.</a>
    </li>

    <li>
    Drag this link to your bookmarks:
    <a href='javascript:(function(){var thumbs,i;thumbs=document.querySelectorAll(".uiMediaThumb i");var html="";for(i=0;i<thumbs.length;i++){var thumb=thumbs[i].style.backgroundImage;var url=thumb.replace(/^url\("(.*)"\)/,"$1");var good_url=url.replace(/_a\.jpg/,"_n.jpg");html=html+"<img src=\""+good_url+"\" />"}document.body.innerHTML=html;})();'>Get photos</a>
    </li>

    <li>
    In Facebook, click on your own name, then click on Photos.
    </li>

    <li>
    Scroll down until it has loaded everything.
    </li>

    <li>
    Click on the bookmark. Your page should disappear and be replaced by full-size photos.
    </li>

    <li>
    Tools -> DownThemAll Tools -> DownThemAll, choose a folder, and click Start.
    </li>

    <li>
    Count your photos to make sure you got everything.
    This doesn't handle videos, so go back and grab those manually.
    </li>
  </ol>
